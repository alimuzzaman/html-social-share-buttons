# PRD: Augment Code Agent Integration for Vulnerability Report Analysis

## 1. Background

The Html Social share buttons plugin (slug: `html-social-share-buttons`) has a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (CVE-2025-9849) in its `zm_sh_btn` shortcode. This PRD defines requirements for an “augment” code-analysis agent that will:

- Ingest the vulnerability report page
- Extract structured details of the issue and remediation guidance
- Scan the plugin source for additional similar vulnerabilities
- Produce a developer-ready summary and actionable to-do list

---

## 2. Objectives

- Automate extraction of vulnerability metadata and remediation steps from HTML report
- Generate clear, numbered issue and solution lists for inclusion in tickets or PR descriptions
- Proactively analyze the codebase for other unsanitized shortcode attributes or missing escaping calls
- Summarize findings and recommend next steps for patch rollout and security review

---

## 3. Scope

In-scope:
- Parsing the provided Vulnerability Report page content
- Listing all reported issues and suggested fixes
- Performing static code analysis on specified plugin files
- Outputting results in Markdown

Out-of-scope:
- Dynamic or runtime analysis
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (future enhancement)

## 4. Vulnerability Details

- **Plugin Name:** Html Social share buttons
- **Plugin Slug:** `html-social-share-buttons`
- **Patched:** No
- **Affected Versions:** ≤ 2.1.16
- **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
- **CVE:** CVE-2025-9849
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium) — CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
- **Reporter:** Peter Thaleikis
- **Report Received:** September 3, 2025
- **Last Updated:** September 4, 2025

### Description & Impact

- The `zm_sh_btn` shortcode concatenates user-supplied attributes directly into HTML without `esc_attr()`
- Authenticated contributors can inject JavaScript that executes on visitor interactions (e.g., mouseover)
- Potential consequences: cookie theft, session hijacking, PII exfiltration

### Root Cause

- **File:** `html-social-share.php`
- **Line:** 304
- **Snippet:**
  ```php
  $output .= "<div class='zmshbt $__class $iconset_id $iconset_type '>";
  ```

### Remediation Guidance

- Sanitize all shortcode attributes with `sanitize_text_field()` or `sanitize_key()`
- Escape each attribute on output with `esc_attr()`
- Reference WP security docs:
  - Sanitizing APIs: https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/sanitizing/
  - Escaping APIs: https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/escaping/

### Recommended Developer Solution

1. Validate and sanitize attributes in the `zm_sh_btn` handler before saving.
2. Wrap attribute outputs in `esc_attr()` when building HTML.
3. Add unit/integration tests that inject unsafe values and assert proper escaping.
4. Update plugin documentation to mandate WP’s sanitization and escaping best practices.

## 5. Functional Requirements

1. **Extract Reported Issues**
   - Parse vulnerability type, components, affected versions, CVE, CVSS, impact summary, root-cause snippet (file + line).
2. **Extract Remediation Guidance**
   - List short remediation instructions and detailed “Recommended Developer Solution” steps.
3. **Format Output**
   - Present issues and solutions as two separate, numbered Markdown lists.
4. **Proactive Code Analysis**
   - Scan specified plugin files for patterns of unsanitized attribute concatenation (e.g., missing `esc_attr()`).
   - For each finding, provide file + line, issue description, and suggested fix.
5. **Summary & Recommendations**
   - Compile an overall summary of existing and additional findings.
   - Recommend next steps (security review, patch rollout plan).

## 6. Data Inputs & Outputs

| Type           | Format                |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| **Input**      | HTML content of the Vulnerability Report page |
| **Output**     | Markdown document containing:
- Numbered list of extracted issues
- Numbered list of remediation steps
- Numbered list of additional code findings
- High-level summary and action recommendations |

---

## 7. Workflow

1. **Ingest Report**
   - Receive raw HTML of the Vulnerability Report page.
2. **Parse & Extract**
   - Identify metadata, description, impact, root cause, remediation guidance.
3. **Static Code Scan**
   - Analyze plugin source for unsanitized attributes.
4. **Generate Output**
   - Build a structured Markdown response with clearly labeled sections.
5. **Deliver Summary**
   - Provide final recommendations for patch rollout and further review.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- Given the HTML of the report, the agent outputs two numbered lists (issues + solutions) matching the extracted details.
- The agent detects at least one additional unsanitized attribute usage in `html-social-share.php` or related files.
- All findings include file names, line numbers, descriptions, and suggested fixes.
- A final summary section clearly outlines next steps for developers and security teams.

---

## 9. Dependencies & Risks

- Access to the plugin source files in the analyze step
- Consistent HTML structure of the Vulnerability Report page
- Risk: false negatives if code patterns vary widely—consider extending regex rules in future

---

## 10. Next Steps

- Review and approve PRD
- Implement agent parsing and scanning modules
- Test against this and additional vulnerability reports
- Iterate on regex/pattern detection to cover broader cases
